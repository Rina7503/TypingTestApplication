Zebras - Africa's striped horses.

There are three species of zebra, all found in Africa. These close relatives of the domestic horse  can be recognized easily by their black and white striped body. 

The Plains or Burchell's zebra is found in open or wooded grasslands from northern South Africa westwards to Etosha Pan in Namibia and north as far as southern Somalia and southern Sudan. The Mountain zebra is found in semi-desert or savanna grasslands in Namibia and South Africa. Grevy's zebra is found in hot, dry semi-deserts in southern and eastern Ethiopia and northern Kenya.

Plains and Mountain zebras stand about 1.3 m at the shoulder and weigh 200 - 380 kg. Grevy's zebras are a little bigger - about 1.4-1.6 m high and up to 450 kg. All zebras have a neat, upright mane.

The three species of zebra can be identified by their stripes. The Plains zebra has stripes that reach under the belly.
